# Move changes

Moves were rebalanced to make some Mons more viable, and overall diversify the options available to the player.


## New moves

There are **three** new moves:
- HEX provides a viable Ghost move. It is learnt by the Gastly line. It is also the only new TM, which can be learnt by Hypno, Ninetales, Marowak and a few others.
- ELECTRO BALL is a signature move for the Voltorb--Electrode line with a high crit rate. Given Electrode's speed and how critical hits are computed in Gen 1, it is essentially the best Electric move in the game.
- WILL-O-WISP is a signature move for the Vulpix--Ninetales line. Given how Ninetales suffers in comparison to Arcanine in Gen 1, this provides it with a much-needed buff (WILL-O-WISP also pairs nicely with HEX).

|--------------|----------|-------|----------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| HEX          | Ghost    | 60    | 100      | 15 | Deals 50% more damage if the opponent has a status condition   |
| ELECTRO BALL | Electric | 55    | 95       | 20 | High critical hit rate (RAZOR LEAF clone)                      |
| WILL-O-WISP  | Fire     | -     | 70       | 15 | Inflicts BURN                                                  |


## Type changes

Move type changes were kept to a minimum, and are primarily meant to give STAB options to Mons who were lacking it. Notably:
- CUT becomes Bug-type, providing a viable early-game Bug-type move and a decent coverage option to check Psychic-types.
- RAZOR WIND becomes a Bug-type weaker version of HYPER BEAM, which due to Gen 1 mechanics can skip the recharge turn if it KOes the opponent.
- STRUGGLE becomes the unused Bird-type to ignore resistances and immunities to Normal-type moves.

| STRUGGLE     | ~~Normal~~ **Bird**   | 50    | 100            | 10 | Bird-type allows STRUGGLE to ignore resistances and immunities              |


## Other changes

Most other changes were made to make most moves at least somewhat viable, or to give them a niche.
In rare cases moves were nerfed, most notably DIG.
